# üìã Sample Prompt
Explain the concept of gravity

# üìã Sample Output
Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that plays a crucial role in the structure and evolution of the universe. It is the force responsible for the attraction between two objects with mass, causing them to be drawn towards each other. The concept of gravity has been studied extensively since ancient times, but it was Sir Isaac Newton who formulated the first comprehensive mathematical description of gravity in his law of universal gravitation.

Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. The magnitude of this force (F) is directly proportional to the product of the two masses (m1 and m2) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between their centers:

F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2.
